# Collaboration Cycle Questionnaire
VSP has created a series of questions for VFS teams to answer early on in their build. These questions help to ensure VFS teams are getting support from the practice areas relevant to their initiative and also help determine which Collaboration Cycle touchpoints are recommended and/or required.

These questions will be asked to the VFS team at their Collaboration Cycle kickoff. VSP will respond in the Github ticket with the recommended Collaboration Cycle touchpoints, as well as any other additional information the team should know.

## High Level Questions
These questions are designed to give VSP basic, high level information about your product/initiative.

### Will your work result in visibile changes to the user experience?
### Is this a new product/feature or an iteration to an existing product/feature?
### Is your work only impacting a static content page?

## Detailed Questions
These questions are more granular and are intended to inform VSP what practice areas are part of your initiative.

### Are you making changes to the visual design?
We ask this question to determine if the practice area of design will need to be involved in your Collaboration Cycle reviews.

**Example:** Adding a new page, modifying the layout of an existing page, 


### Are you making changes to copy/content?
**Example:** 

### Are there any changes to the user flow?
### Are there any changes to urls, navigation or entry points?
### Are you doing research with VA.gov users?
### Does your product/feature have Google Analytics tracking and a KPI dashboard in Domo?
